# ⚽ FootballPlatform

**FootballPlatform** is a cloud-native data platform that ingests, transforms, and analyzes football match data — starting with the UEFA Champions League.

The project follows modern **analytics engineering** and **data platform** best practices on Google Cloud.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The platform runs entirely on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and includes:

- 🌩️ **Cloud Functions** for ingesting and validating football match data from external APIs
- 🧱 **dbt (Data Build Tool)** for transforming raw data into analytics-ready models
- 🧠 **BigQuery** as the central data warehouse
- 🐳 **Docker + Cloud Build** for reproducible dbt builds
- ▶️ **Cloud Run Jobs** to execute dbt in a serverless and scalable way
- 🔄 **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD and automated deployments
- 📊 **Looker Studio** for analytics and reporting

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Google Cloud Platform**
  - Cloud Functions
  - Cloud Storage
  - BigQuery
  - Artifact Registry
  - Cloud Build
  - Cloud Run Jobs
- **dbt** (v1.10+)
- **Docker**
- **GitHub Actions (OIDC / Workload Identity Federation)**
- **Python** (3.10+)
- **Looker Studio**

---

## 🔄 CI/CD & Deployment Flow

The dbt project is deployed automatically via **GitHub Actions**.

### High-level flow

1. A push to `main` triggers the GitHub Actions workflow
2. A **Docker image** containing the dbt project is built using **Cloud Build**
3. The image is tagged with the Git commit SHA (immutable)
4. The image is pushed to **Artifact Registry**
5. The **Cloud Run Job** is updated to use the new image

This ensures:
- fully reproducible dbt runs
- immutable deployments
- no “latest” or mutable tags in production

---

## 🧪 Development & Deployment

### Running dbt locally

```bash
cd dbt
dbt build
```

### In production

dbt is executed via Cloud Run Jobs, using the Docker image built by the CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 📅 Roadmap

✅ Raw data ingestion from bucket to BigQuery

✅ dbt models for staging and marts

✅ Dockerized dbt builds

✅ CI/CD with GitHub Actions

✅ Cloud Run Jobs for dbt execution

✅ End-to-end orchestration (scheduler / DAG)

⏳ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

✅ Automated tests & data quality checks

---

## 📦 Data Source

Match data is sourced from Football-Data.org, a free public API for football data.
